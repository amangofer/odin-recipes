		<h2>It's Chili by George!!</h2>
		<p>Chili — also called chili con carne or "chili with meat" — may have its roots in Spanish cuisine. This spicy stew has been known in America since the early 1800s, and possibly before then. It was originally a food for those who couldn't afford good cuts of meat, or for the pioneers going west. They used dried beef, fat, salt, and peppers together to form "chili bricks," which were then cooked out on the trail.</p>
		<p>This beef chili recipe with tomato juice and beans can be made on the stove or in the slow cooker. It's quick, easy, and so good.</p>
